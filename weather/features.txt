Add ability to remember message from user entered before we know the trip context of a session.
Add support for google maps API
Support different start / end dates for group travel.
Support "expenses:" comment going in the right bucket on landing page.

Notes:
Some questions I would have liked answers for when planning:
1) How safe is Israel/Jordan?
2) What cities in Japan are good to travel (weather wise) in February?
3) Hainan tourism value, safety, flight details.

Activities workflow:
1) First, help users determine the cities they should choose (based on time of travel, their interests, traveling group (traveling with kid) etc.)
2) Based on cities chosen, identify activities in each city (top 3 activities) based on interest, traveling group  and update it.
