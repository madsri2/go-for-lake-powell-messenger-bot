Consumer Notices

Notice of Incorporated Terms of Contract: Carriage, whether international,
domestic or a domestic portion of an international journey, is subject to
the individual terms of transporting air carriers, which are incorporated
herein by reference and made part of the contract of carriage. Incorporated
terms include, but are not limited to:

1. Limits of liability for personal injury or death of passengers.
2. Limits on liability for loss, damage to, or delayed delivery of
passenger baggage, including fragile or perishable goods.
3. Claims restrictions, including time periods in which a passenger must
file a claim or bring an action against the carrier for its acts or
omissions or those of its agents.
4. Rights of the carrier to change terms of the contract.
5. Rules on reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, refusal to
carry, and smoking.
6. Rights of the carrier and limitations concerning delay or failure to
perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate air
carrier or aircraft, and rerouting.

You can obtain additional information on items (1) through (6) at any U.S.
location where the transporting air carrier’s tickets are sold. You have
the right to inspect the full text of each transporting air carrier’s terms
at its U.S. airport and city ticket offices. You also have the right, upon
request, to receive free of charge the full text of the applicable terms
incorporated by reference from each of the transporting carriers.
Information on ordering the full text of each carrier’s terms is available
at any U.S. location where the air carrier’s tickets are sold, or you can
click on the Contract of Carriage links below.

Notice–Overbooking of Flights:
Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat
will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed
reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat
until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their
reservation in exchange for compensation of the airline’s choosing. If
there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other
persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few
exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier’s check-in
deadline which are available upon request from the air carrier, persons
denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete
rules for the payment of compensation and each airline’s boarding
priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding
locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel
from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be
available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.

Domestic Baggage Liability: For travel entirely within the United States,
Virgin America’s maximum liability for checked baggage is $3,500 per
passenger, and Virgin America assumes no responsibility for fragile,
irreplaceable or perishable items.

Advice to International Passengers on Carrier Liability: Passengers on a
journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than
the country of departure are advised that international treaties known as
the Montreal Convention, or its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention,
including its amendments (the Warsaw Convention system), may apply to the
entire journey, including any portion thereof within a country. For such
passengers, the applicable treaty, including special contracts of carriage
embodied in any applicable tariffs, governs and may limit the liability of
the carrier in respect of death or injury to passengers, and for
destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers
and baggage.
